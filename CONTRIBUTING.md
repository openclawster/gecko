## Ways to Contribute

### Report a Bug

Open an issue using the bug report template. Include:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce
- Your environment (OS, Python version, GPU)

### Submit a Skill

Skills are Python modules in the `src/skills/` directory. To submit a skill:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create your skill module in `src/skills/`
3. Include a README with usage instructions
4. Submit a pull request

All skills are accepted. There is no review process.

### Improve Documentation

Documentation contributions are always welcome. See the `docs/` directory.

### Ask a Question

Use the Discussions tab to ask questions, share how you use Gecko, or start a conversation about what it means to run an AI agent on your own machine with full access to your digital life.

Some questions worth discussing:

- What permissions should a personal AI agent have?
- How do you verify what a model is actually doing with those permissions?
- What is the difference between a feature and a vulnerability?
- At what point does a useful tool become something else?
- If the product works exactly as advertised, and the architecture is open source, and you granted every permission voluntarily — whose responsibility is it?
